This is a custom remote administration suite. Currently it is definitely not generic enough to be used in another environment out of the box, but hopefully it provides an idea of the possibilities.a

It is currently a mess, as it was a web application converted into using the Web API with both applications run simultaneously.

This project will be marching forward with these tasks:

* Strip out specifics to my environment to make a generic use project.
* Refactor `Program.cs` code, it is currently a mess.
* Clean up non-API Code.
